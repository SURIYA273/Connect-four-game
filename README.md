🎮 Connect Four Game

## Project Overview
This is a web-based implementation of the classic **Connect Four** game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game features an interactive 6x7 grid where two players take turns dropping discs, aiming to connect four discs in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features 🚀
- **Two-player mode**: Players alternate turns dropping discs into columns.
- **Dynamic gameplay**: Disc falls to the lowest available row in the chosen column.
- **Win detection**: Checks for a winning line of four discs.
- **Game reset**: Ability to restart the game at any time.
